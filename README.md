This repository contains the C code to generate the Mandelbrot 'mandelbrot.c'
and the executable generated after compilation 'mandelbrot'.
The executable will dump the data into a file called 'Mandelbrot_Set.dat' 
which later can be plotted using the gnuplot file 'gnuplot.txt' and produce the image 'printme.png'
